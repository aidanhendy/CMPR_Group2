add any major changes here

To get this in your own machine:

VS Code: copy repoitory in the green code button and copy paste link in there or use in software way

will need to terminal git pull to get any changes u dont have

to push a change to github use 1. git add . 2. git commit -m "whatever" 3. git push (all terminal commands)

Visual Studio: Ask Jay

Note that making a brach for yourself might be needed idk

Lastly if needed you can add stuff manually with copy paste just make a new branch for it unless not needed
